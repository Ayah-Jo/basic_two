            <p>There is a say in Africa which goes like this: "One cannot stop sleeping because of fear of bad dreams". This proverb just means that there are things in life that are beyond our control. Ironically, the things that we worry about the most are the ones that we cannot control. Stop asking yourself questions like What if this happens? What if that happens? What if this doesn't happen? What if that doesn't happen? You can't stop birds from flying over your head but you can keep them from building a nest in your hair. The ups and downs in life are what make it interesting. The happiest people don't have the best of everything but they make the best of everything they have. Take care of today and tomorrow will take care of itself.I came to the United States a few years ago with this mindset, and since have been able to accomplish myriad of things for myself.I am a migrant and sometimes, I have nostalgia for my homeland. Other times, I feel like I won the lottery. I consider myself a citizen of the world, rich in experiences from one corner of the world to the other. I am interested in talking about growth, life experiences, leadership, politics, travel, religion, food, etc... because there is no limit to what one can learn.</p>
